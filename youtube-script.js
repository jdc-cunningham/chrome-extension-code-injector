 * note the offset units in the overlay are based on the UI as of 08/08/2020
 * as of now, this is only intended for use on Desktop, trying to actually bind to elements on page
 * as I initially did takes too long/still see the stuff that's trying to be hidden before script works
 * also note my monitor that I mainly use is at least 1920px resolution, height doesn't seem to matter.
